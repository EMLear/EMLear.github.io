                <p>The brief was to work in a group to design three chocolate bar wrappers. The wrappers had to have a
                    theme of Scottish mythical creatures. The three creatures chosen were Unicorn, Selkie, and Faerie. I
                    worked on the Unicorn.</p>
                <p>As a group in this project, we had to research Scottish mythology, create colour palettes and mood
                    boards, research the target market, high-end and low-end competitors, the average pricing per
                    chocolate content, the history of chocolate, and how chocolate is made.</p>
                <p>During the design process, I found that my initial design didn't match the rest of my group's
                    designs. This was because I had included a photograph in my design, while the group had used only
                    illustration. Upon reflection, I decided that I could not make the design work, so I changed it to
                    an illustrated approach.</p>
