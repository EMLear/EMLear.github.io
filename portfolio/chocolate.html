                        <p>The brief was to work in a group to three create a chocolate bar wrappers. The wrapper had to have a theme of a Scottish mythical creature the three creatures chosen where Unicorn,selkie and farie. i worked on the unicorn.</p>
                        <p>As a group in this project we had to reasearch scottish mythology , create colour palletes and mood boeards, target market, competitiors , avarage pricing per chocolate content , and how the chocolate was made.</p>
                        <p>During the design process I found that my initial design didn't match the rest of my group's designs. This was because I had a photograph included in my design and the group had used only illustration. Upon reflection I decided that I could not make the design work so changed it to an illustrated approach</p>
