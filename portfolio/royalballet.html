                        <p> This breif was part of the royal oprea and ballet compition of 2025 this breif was about the winters tale. out of all three visions i chose vison 2. to mske us stand out our lechurer encouraged us to create a zine (mini magazine) to go along with our poster which could conation information such as actors,times and sonupisi of the ballet. </p>
                        <p>Vision 2 - Juxtaposition
                            Christoper Wheeldon's ballet shows us two very different worlds . The gathering places we see in Bohemia is light, effervescent and exuberant. The court in Sicila is the opposite in every way: cold, dark and austere.
                            How can you visually describe these two contrasting places using colour and abstraction? 
                            Research multiple artists and idea which inspire you and then find you own visual expression of the two places in your designs</p>
                        <p> For this project i had to do a lot of reaseach with included a colour skeme, mood boards for both Bohemia and Sicila,artist reasearch, character research ,enviromental imacr and target market reaseach.</p>
