                <p>This brief was part of the Royal Opera and Ballet competition of 2025. The brief focused on *The
                    Winter's Tale*. Out of all three visions, I chose Vision 2. To help us stand out, our lecturer
                    encouraged us to create a zine (mini magazine) to accompany our poster, which could contain
                    information such as performers, timings, acknowledgements, and a synopsis of the ballet.</p>
                <p><strong>Vision 2 - Juxtaposition</strong><br>
                    Christopher Wheeldon's ballet shows us two very different worlds. The gathering places we see in
                    Bohemia are light, effervescent, and exuberant. The court in Sicilia is the opposite in every way:
                    cold, dark, and austere.<br>
                    How can you visually describe these two contrasting places using colour and abstraction?<br>
                    Research multiple artists and ideas that inspire you, and then find your own visual expression of
                    the two places in your designs.</p>
                <p>For this project, my group and I had to do a lot of research, which included a colour scheme, mood
                    boards for both Bohemia and Sicilia, artist research, character research, environmental impact, and
                    target market analysis.</p>
                <p>For the zine, we had to create a layout which, once printed, is folded along the lines. The layout
                    was decorated so that it matched each of our posters.</p>
