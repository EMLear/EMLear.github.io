                <p>Client: Granton College</p>
                <p>A group of second-year students in the foundational course—seven in total—were tasked with
                    creating a poster for the Granton Christmas Singalong. The poster had to be non-religious and
                    inclusive. It also had to include the information provided.</p>
                <p>We were given two weeks to create the poster, which was then judged by a panel, and the favourite
                    was displayed around the Granton area.</p>
                <p>This project was a real time crunch and was designed to give us a taste of working in the
                    graphics world with tight deadlines.</p>
